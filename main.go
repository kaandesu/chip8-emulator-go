/*NOTE:
  The first CHIP-8 interpreter (on the COSMAC VIP computer)
  was also located in RAM, from address 000 to 1FF. It
  would expect a CHIP-8 program to be loaded into memory after
  it, starting at address 200 (512 in decimal). Although modern
  interpreters are not in the same memory space, you should do the
  same to be able to run the old programs; you can just
  leave the initial space empty, except for the font.
